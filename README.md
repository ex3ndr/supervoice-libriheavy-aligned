# âœ¨ Libriheavy Aligned

Alinged using MFA libriheavy dataset. Most of the dataset is aligned using version `2.2.17` of MFA and few files were aligned using `3.3.1`. Used ASR outputs, and NOT original text. I have found that original text contains mistakes (like page numbers) and can't always be aligned properly.
